# The Tempest's Box
The Tempest's Box is a Minecraft command project spanning [4 years](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BSuQ29kRXKU), created by [Jragon014](https://youtube.com/channel/UC_LBXGLs8Sa0opJHFVDVBqA), that adds countless features that add to the game under the themes of magic and exploration. The project was revived by myself after 2 years of inactivity, and later taken over by Andante.

The *TTB Mod* project was created as a learning experience for myself of how to program in *Java* and use [*FabricMC*](https://fabricmc.net) to create a mod.
